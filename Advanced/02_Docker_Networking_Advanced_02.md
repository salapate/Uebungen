# Assignment: DNS Round Robin Test
***
In this assignment you will use multiple created networks to respond to one DNS address. 

1. Create two Elastic Search Containers from the Image ```elasticsearch:2```
2. Make sure when creating the images to use the option ```–network-alias search``` to give the containers an additional DNS name to respond to
3. Run a container from an alpine image with the command ```nslookup``` to verify the ip addresses that respond to the alias ```search.network```
4. Run a container from a centos image with the command ```curl –s search:9200``` on the msi network and monitor whether the output changes (check "name", Elasticsearch names itsself differently whenever a container is started) everytime you rerun the container.
